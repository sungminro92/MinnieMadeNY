I have them on the table & every morning I see them. They give me a morning kiss :) & I smile back @ them. Just what I expected. Thank you for making these!",

She kept in constant contact making sure the flowers were exactly what I needed and expected. They arrived today and are better than I expected. I think my Daniel would be proud of his bouquet. In his favorite colors of Red and Black too!! Lori Salsbury",

She was in constant communication with me and sent photos to get my input. I'm thrilled beyond belief!!!! And once I approved the colors and design, she got them off to me so quickly. I appreciate the workmanship and great customer service this artist provides. Did I mention she didn't charge extra for a custom job.",

My teenage son selected these wire flowers to put in a glass bottle he salvaged from our local creek and is re-using as a vase. They add so much pop and fun to wherever we place them. I'll be sad to see them go if they accompany him to college next year. I highly recommend this seller and expect to make more purchases going forward.",

These look just like the images, and are made well. I liked that the wire was bendable too. It was really tough to figure out which ones to get because there are so many great choices. I'm sure I'll be back to purchase more. A bouquet would make a perfect gift for anyone at any time of year! And the owner tucked in a little gift because I made a purchase at a special time of year, which was unexpected, just as lovely as the flowers, and much appreciated.",
